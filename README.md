# Belly-Button-Challenge
In this assignment, I build an interactive dashboard to explore the [**Belly Button Biodiversity dataset**](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/)., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.


# Deliverables Overview
This assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables.

### Deliverable 1: Horizontal Bar Chart
### Deliverable 2: Bubble Chart
### Deliverable 3: Gauge Chart

## Deliverable One:
One horizontal Bar Chart displaying the top 10 bacterial species (_OTUs_) when a participants’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.

## Deliverable Two:

A bubble chart that displays the amount of each bacteria present in the participants belly button when that patient’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage. The _otu_ids_ act as our _x-axis_ values and the _sample_values_ as our _y-axis_ values. The _sample_values_ also act as the _marker size_. The _otu_ids_ also acts as the _marker colors_. The _otu_labels_ act as the _hover-text values_.

## Deliverable Three:

A Gauge Chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an participant's ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
